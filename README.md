# Arabic-Sentiment-Analysis

## This repo was implemented using TensorFlow=2.8.0

This repo was created with minumum code just to give you an idea of how to use sentiment analysis and understand the basics of NLP and basic nural network model.

## How to use
* The file (Trainer.py) is used to train the model, if you want to train your own model with your own data use it.
* The file (Model.py) is used to test and try the model, use it to try My model.
* Other files are needed for (Model.py), if you used (Trainer.py) it will create another copy of those files for you.
* The file (poem.json) is the data sample.

## Data
data used to train the model were 3100 verse, the sample in the repo is only 300(poem.json), if you need any more(20k+) contact me.

## Resorces 
most of the code was snapped out of tensorflow tutorials and only the important parts were used.
